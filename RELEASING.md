# Releasing
		
You will need permission in sonatype to push to `com.lightbend.akka` groupd ID.
 
 1. Ask someone in the Akka team to rename the 'akka-persistence-spanner-xx-stable' report in [WhiteSource](https://saas.whitesourcesoftware.com) to reflect the latest version (unfortunately this requires permissions that cannot be shared in a granular way)
 1. Check [closed issues without a milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-spanner/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20no%3Amilestone) and either assign them the 'upcoming' release milestone or 'invalid'
 1. Create a [new release](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-spanner/releases/new) with:
     * the next tag version (e.g. `v0.21`)
     * title and release description including notable changes
     * link to the [milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-spanner/milestones) showing an overview of closed issues for this release
     * overview of contributors generated by [`sbt-authors`](https://github.com/2m/authors)
 1. Travis CI will start a [CI build](https://travis-ci.com/github/akka/akka-persistence-spanner/builds) for the new tag and publish artifacts to Bintray.
     * When the travis build fails it must be restarted. Artifacts may already have been pushed to Bintray, however, so remove them there before restarting the build.
 1. Login to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/akka/maven/akka-persistence-spanner) and sync artifacts to Maven Central:
     * Go to the 'Maven Central' tab and use your sonatype credentials. This can take a long time (you can check https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories for progress)
 1. Close the milestone for this release and start a new one.
 1. For the documentation publishing step, you will have to have access to the Gustav docs server.
     1. Log into `gustav.akka.io` as `akkarepo`
         1. update the `current` link to point to the latest version with
             ```
             ln -nsf <version> www/docs/akka-persistence-spanner/current
             ```
         1. check changes and commit the new version to the local git repository
             ```
             cd ~/www
             git add docs/akka-persistence-spanner/current docs/akka-persistence-spanner/<version>
             git commit -m "Akka Persistence Spanner <version>"
             ```
