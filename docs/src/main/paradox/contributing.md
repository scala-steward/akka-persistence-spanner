## Running the tests

The tests expect a locally running Spanner Emulator.

It can be started with the docker-comopse file in the docker folder:

### Running tests against Google Spanner

To run the tests against Spanner set the JVM property `akka.spanner.real-spanner` to "true".

The default configuration uses the project `akka-team` and the instance `akka`. These can be overridden in `SpannerSpec.scala` for all tests.
